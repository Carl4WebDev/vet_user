              Welcome to VetConnect, a digital platform designed to streamline

              engagement. By accessing or using the VetConnect System you
              acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to comply
              with these Terms and Conditions, including our Privacy Policy, in
              compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No.
